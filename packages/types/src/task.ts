// The task contract (docs/design/v2-architecture.md §3.8): how every activity-type extension
// (games, the browser) and the ActivityManager (§3.2) report work that takes time.
//
// One task = one id from `started` to exactly one terminal event (`done` or `failed`). Nobody
// guesses completion from event names, "失敗" prefixes or settle timers any more: the executor
// that does the work says when it is over and why. A stale task (cancelled, superseded, timed
// out) must be harmless: its late events are ignored by id.
//
// On the bus a task owner `<owner>` (e.g. `game.minecraft`, `activity`) publishes
// `<owner>.task.started|progress|done|failed|steered` custom events (`taskTopic`) whose payload is
// the `TaskEvent` (internally tagged by `type`). `steered` is not a lifecycle end: it reports how
// a change of direction (`TaskSteer`, docs/design/v3-architecture.md §10.6) went. `@miyoria/sdk` carries its own copy of these shapes
// for extensions (it does not depend on this package).
