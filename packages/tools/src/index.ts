// @miyoria/tools: tools the model may call during a turn.

// The app creates one `ToolRegistry` at boot and provides it as `ToolRegistryKey`; any module
// (memory, extensions, MCP, ...) may register and unregister tools at any time. The agent
// offers the registered tools to the model and checks permissions against the user who
// triggered the turn, never against the model.
