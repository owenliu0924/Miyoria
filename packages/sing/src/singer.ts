// The singing flow (docs/design/autonomy.md §22):
//
//   request ── worker job ──► preparing ──► ready ──► (she decides / forced) ──► playing ──► done
//
// * A request (her `sing_request` tool, `/queue song request`, a called `[modules.queue]` item
//   of kind `song`) adds a set list entry and submits a worker job; she keeps talking meanwhile.
// * Ready: songs asked for by command or the queue are sung as soon as she is in voice and free
//   (forced). Others are offered to her mind (`MindKey.suggest`), which picks the moment with a
//   `sing.play` intent and an opening line; she is reminded a couple of times, and her turns see
//   the set list (prompt section `sing`). Without a mind, ready songs start on their own.
// * Before a song starts she finishes what she is saying (the turn that started it, then a quiet
//   moment). While it plays the module holds her voice channel (`VoiceFloorKey`: her speech there
//   is dropped instead of queueing behind the song), barge-in does not apply (it is not her
//   speech), and only `sing.stop` (skip / stop) ends it early.
// * After a song that played to the end she is told, so she can say something about it.
// * When the worker takes the whole GPU to convert (its TTS / ASR go away for a minute or two),
//   she first says she is off to prepare it, and only then does the worker go ahead
//   (`exclusive: "waiting"` → `goExclusive`). Meanwhile speech is paused (`SpeechPauseKey`,
//   `SPEECH_PAUSE_TOPIC`): the voice module neither speaks nor transcribes, the overlay says so.
// * The song being prepared, its worker stage and progress are published as
//   `SONG_PREPARE_TOPIC` whenever they change (the overlay's activity line).
