// The director: one game session at a time, a decision every `decide_secs` (sooner on important
// events), goal tracking, queue goals, commentary and mood nudges.
//
// The director (and its model) only chooses goals and commentary. Every goal is a task on the
// game's executor (v2 §3.8): the director picks the task id and budget, starts it through the
// gate (`game.act`, principal `director`) and learns how it ended from the executor's
// `game.<id>.task.done|failed` events, each failure with a code. Nothing is guessed from event
// names, settle times or "失敗" prefixes; stale tasks (replaced, cancelled) are ignored by id.
